#### SnpEff Documentation

SnpEff is a tool used to annotate and predict the effect of genetic variants.

#### Input
SnpEff takes a VCF (variant call format) file as input (usually obtained after a sequencing experiment) . This file contains the predicted variants like SNPs, insertions, deletions and MNPs.
The location of the variant is discribed by the chromosome name and position.

#### Processing
The effect impact is used to determine the impact the variant has on the genes. The main difference between a HIGH and a LOW impact is that a HIGH impact means that, according tot he SnpEff program, the variant results in damaging effects on the gene, while a LOW impact means that the variant has no damaging effects on the gene. A MODERATE impact has a more harmful effect on the gene than the LOW impact, but not as high as the HIGH impact.

The effects and annotations that SnpEff can calculate are listed in Tabel 1 below.

Tabel 1 Effect types SnpEff can calculate and their meanings
Effect type	Meaning	Example
SNP	Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism	Reference = 'A', Sample = 'C'
Ins	Insertion	Reference = 'A', Sample = 'AGT'
Del	Deletion	Reference = 'AC', Sample = 'C'
MNP	Multiple-nucleotide polymorphism	Reference = 'ATA', Sample = 'GTC'
MIXED	Multiple-nucleotide and an InDel	Reference = 'ATA', Sample = 'GTCAGT'


Variants are the differences between a genome and a reference genome1. The places in the genome where the sample differs from the reference genome are called “genomic variants” or “variants”. Variants can be categorized as shown in Table 1.

#### Output
SnpEff examines the input variants and returns the variants after annotating and calculating the effects on (known) genes1. The output of SnpEff is a huge file, it contains the differences between the used sample and the reference genome. The output is a bit similar to the VCF file used as input, the main difference is that the INFO-section is added to it. This section tells a bit more about the effect of the variant.

variants_effect_splice_donor_variant 	The variant hits a Splice donor site (defined as two bases after coding exon end, except for the last exon). 	HIGH

variants_effect_splice_region_variant 	A sequence variant in which a change has occurred within the region of the splice site, either within 1-3 bases of the exon or 3-8 bases of the intron. 	LOW
