# feature_fasta

This repository contains all fasta files generated by the most recent run of the [slice script](../../script/slice_script.py).

Files are named according to a specific convention:
featureType:geneId:locationStart:locationEnd.extention
- The extention can either be 'fa', signifying the file contains the sequences as nucleotides; or as 'aa', in which case the sequences are stored as aminoacids.
