## Scripts
This folder contains all custom scripts created to complete this project, including a general usage description. 

# Slice script
This script slices the DNA-sequence of features in a GFF3-file from the corresponding genome fasta file, creating a fasta file with these sequences.

Use: currently, the script takes input files with a pre-specified name in the same directory as the script. These names are as follows:
- input GFF3: testgff3_01.txt
- input genome: testfasta_01.fasta
